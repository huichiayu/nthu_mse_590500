This course aims to train students with modern computer programming languages to enhance their understandings to the core principles of materials science and engineering. We target junior/senior/graduate students who have explored to the core courses, such as thermodynamics, phase transformation, engineering math, laboratories of materials, etc. Students will learn basic Python programming skills and then use programming on the applications of calculating thermodynamical quantities, identify phase equilibria and phase boundaries, of simulating diffusion and phase transformation processes, and of machine learning and analyzing materials science data. The overarching goal is to equip future materials scientists and engineers early on with programming and computational skills, such that they will apply these methods to solve problems in a fundamentally different way from the current customs; specifically, with algorithmic thinkings in investigating/analyzing phenomena/problems. This ability is particularly critical in the coming AI era: in a way that human thinking can verify what AI feeds to humans.
